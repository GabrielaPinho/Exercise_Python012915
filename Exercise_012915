## How many times will 'hello' be printed?

# 1) 14
# 2) 4
# 3) 3+3, but the number 3 works for both options, so python dont "use" it for the second option. Because of that it will appear only 5 "hello"s.
# 4) 5
# 5) 8

#Basic programming
# What does fooXX do?
foo1 is a function that returns the squared root of x
foo2 returns x if x is bigger than y and returns y if x is not bigger than y 
foo3 returns the same values of x, y and z, but sorted from the smaller to the bigger
foo4 returns the last number generated by the "for", that is the factorial of x
foo5 will return the factorial of x
